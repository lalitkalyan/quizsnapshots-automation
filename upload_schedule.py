upload_schedule.py
------------------

Upload and schedule videos to YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram
Reels. This placeholder implementation does not actually perform
uploads; instead, it updates the status of queue entries to
``PUBLISHED`` to simulate successful scheduling. In a production
version, integrate the YouTube Data API and respective TikTok/Instagram
upload endpoints.

Usage:

    python upload_schedule.py

Configuration files:
    config/ops.yml

Data files:
    data/publish_queue.csv
